libpam-cgm
==========

In the past, Ubuntu carried a systemd patch to provide logged-in users
with cgroups which they could administer.  This can now be done by the
pam_cgm module.

By default, pam_cgm will create a new cgroup for the user for all
controllers other than name=systemd.  The default listof controllers
to use is listed in /usr/share/pam-configs/cgm.  To edit the list,
do so in /etc/pam.d/common-session.
